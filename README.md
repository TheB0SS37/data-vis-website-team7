## Loading Data

Dataset named dataset_v4.csv should be placed in a folder data/dataset_v4.csv relative to where the index.html file is. This should already be the case if downloaded from a zip file.

## Dependencies

All code dependencies are automatically loaded from CDN's

## How to run locally

The easiest way to run the project properly is using the Visual Studio Code Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey:

Open a workspace from the folder containing index.html, then press Go Live in the bottom right corner of Visual Studio Code. A browser window should open containing the app.
